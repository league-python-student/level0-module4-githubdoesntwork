"""
Youâ€™re going to draw a face with eyes that will follow the mouse!
"""

# 1. Find an image on the internet and drop it into your sketch.
# It can be anything as long as it has large eyes!

def setup():
    # 2. Import your image using the following code:
    # global face
    # face = loadImage("big_eye_bird.png")

    
    # 3. Set the size of your sketch and the size of your image to be
    # the same by entering the following code in the setup method.
    # size(800, 600)
    # face.resize(width, height)

    
def draw():
    # 4. Draw your image using:
    # global face
    # background(face)

    # 5. Place a white ellipse over the left eye of your image.
    # fill(<your color>)
    # ellipse(x, y, width, height)
    println(str(mouseX) + ' ' + str(mouseY))   
    
    # 6. Now add a pupil (the black part) to the left eye earlier.
    # Use the pupil x and y variables for the position.
    
    # 7. Run the program and check if the left eye is in the correct
    # position
    
    # 8. To make the pupil follow the mouse, the pupil's x and y positions
    # should be set to mouseX and mouseY when the mouse is inside the eye.
    # Use the is_mouse_inside_eye() function for this.
    #
    # If the mouse is not inside the eye, call the get_eye_position()
    # function:
    # position = get_eye_position(left_eye_x, left_eye_y, eye_radius, pupil_radius)
    # ellipse(position.x, position.y, pupil_radius * 2, pupil_radius * 2)
    
    # 9. Repeat the steps above for the right eye and observe the googly eyes!
